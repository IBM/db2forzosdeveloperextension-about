IBM&reg; Db2&reg; for z/OS&reg; Developer Extension is an extension for Microsoft Visual Studio Code that provides language support for Db2 for z/OS SQL, including embedded statements in non-SQL file types such as COBOL, Python, Java, and Node.js.

Db2 Developer Extension modernizes the experience of developing Db2 for z/OS applications by bringing the following key capabilities into one of today's most popular and widely used development environments:

**Basic productivity features:**
- SQL formatting
- Code completion and signature help
- Syntax checking and highlighting
- Customizable code snippet support
- Integrated support for connecting to Db2 databases
- Db2 catalog navigation

**Features for running SQL:**
- The ability to run selected SQL statements from any type of file
- The ability to display consolidated results from running multiple SQL statements
- The ability to select multiple SQL elements on different lines and run those elements as a complete statement
- The ability to commit or rollback the results of SQL transactions
- The ability to limit the number of rows in SQL result sets
- The ability to use null values, validate XML, and retain input values
- The ability to sort query history by the timestamp of the execution and to quickly identify and display failing SQL statements
- The ability to run SQL with or without parameter markers and host variables and to save SQL execution results
- The ability to modify and re-run SQL from the query history

**Features for working with native stored procedures:**
- The ability to deploy, run, and debug native stored procedures
- The ability to define conditional hit-count breakpoints when debugging stored procedures
- The ability to run SQL that includes parameters and variables from within a native stored procedure

**Features for analyzing and tuning SQL:**
- The ability to analyze and tune SQL by using the extended set of tuning features that are provided with Query Workload Tuner for z/OS 6.1 or by using the base subset of those tuning features that are provided with Database Services Expansion Pack (Visual Explain, Statistics Advisor, and Capture Query Environment). See [Software requirements for using the SQL tuning features]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/tuning-sql-queries/sql-tuning-requirements.html) for more information.
- Create, migrate, and drop EXPLAIN tables
- Configure tuning options
- Save a history of your tuning activities
