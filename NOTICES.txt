derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other

Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name)
to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any

Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity

2. Grant of Copyright License.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a
perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute
the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
3. Grant of Patent License.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a
perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this
section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the
Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are
necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the
Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution
incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent
licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation
is filed.
4. Redistribution.
You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium,
with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following
conditions:
1.	You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
2.	You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the
files; and
3.	You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright,
patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those

the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the
Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such
third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational
purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within
Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from
the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying
the License.
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or
different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the
Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
5. Submission of Contributions.
Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the
Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any
additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such
Contributions.
6. Trademarks.
This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or

7. Disclaimer of Warranty.
Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR
CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties
or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or
redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this
License.
8. Limitation of Liability.

unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in
writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the
use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work
stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even
if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.
While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee
for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent
with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and
on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
