Db2 Developer Extension takes advantage of VSCode's **Format Document** and **Format Selection** capabilities by allowing you to format SQL within all SQL file types, including .ddl, .spsql, .sql, .javaspsql, and .udfsql files.

The ability to format your SQL makes it much easier to parse large blocks of code and to understand the relationship between different blocks of SQL elements and clauses.

The formatting actions are available from the editor context menu, as keyboard shortcuts, and from the [Command Palette]({{site.baseurl}}/2021/06/15/Running-commands-from-the-command-palette.html).
