Visual Studio Code's [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) allows you to execute commands quickly without navigating through the user interface. Visual Studio Code provides built-in commands, and Db2 Developer Extension provides its own commands.

To run a Db2 Dev Extension command, open the **Command Palette** and start typing "Db2 Developer Extension." You'll be presented with a list of all the extension-related commands that you can execute.
