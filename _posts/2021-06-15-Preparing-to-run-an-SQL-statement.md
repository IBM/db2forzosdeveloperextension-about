When you have some valid SQL and you have a valid database connection, you're just about ready to run it.Â There's a little bit of optional set up you might want to do first.

1. Create and save a simple SQL statement. For example, the following statement selects the entire contents (a single row) of the Db2 sample table SYSIBM.SYSDUMMY1:
```
SELECT * FROM
SYSIBM.SYSDUMMY1
```

2. Right-click anywhere in your .sql file and select **Run SQL Options** from the context menu to open the following view:

    ![Run SQL Options]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/getting-started-run-sql-options.png)

    Use this view to set the following options for running your SQL:

    - Whether to always use an existing database connection to run this script or open a new database connection every time you run this script.
    - The circumstances under which changes are [committed or rolled back]({{site.baseurl}}/2021/03/16/Committing-and-rolling-back-changes.html).
    - The statement termination character to use if you don't want to use the default semicolon (;) character.
    - Values for the [CURRENT SCHEMA](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEPEK_12.0.0/sqlref/src/tpc/db2z_currentschema.html) and [CURRENT PATH](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEPEK_12.0.0/sqlref/src/tpc/db2z_currentpath.html) special registers and whether these values are always converted to uppercase letters.

3. Now, you can run your SQL by using any of the following methods: 

    - Right-click anywhere in your SQL file and click **Run All**.

    - Highlight your SELECT statement, right-click anywhere in your SQL file and click **Run Selected SQL**. This option is useful for testing and debugging individual SQL statements.

    - Use the Visual Studio Code [Command Palette]({{site.baseurl}}/2021/06/15/Running-commands-from-the-command-palette.html).

    The results are displayed in the **SQL Results** page that opens when the statement completes and stored in the **QUERY HISTORY** menu in ther right sidebar. You can also save the results in a **.csv** file or in a spreadsheet.
