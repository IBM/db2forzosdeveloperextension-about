## Features
### Syntax highlighting 

Syntax highlighting makes it easier to visually parse your code and to identify particular syntax elements based solely on their appearance. Db2 Developer Extension classifies all elements of a particular type into a group and applies a highlighting theme at the group level so that it's easy to customize highlighting themes.

The following example shows the default highlighting theme:

### Code snippets
Db2 Developer Extension provides code snippets for the most commonly used SQL syntax, complete with required parameters and options. These snippets provide you with a starting point that you can quickly build upon to create the SQL statements that you need and to customize snippets for your particular needs.

The following example shows how to select and insert various SQL DDL statements:
